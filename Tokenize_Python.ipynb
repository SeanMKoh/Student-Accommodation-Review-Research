Staff didn’t tell me when a repair I had was due and entered my room while I was out which is very concerning and an invasion of privacy and didn’t say anything when I said as much - again didn’t seem to care.

It's in a great location only a few minutes to get to the shops or uni and its right across the street from Wetherspoons. Its got a free on site gym and cinema room which always appeared to be well kept, as well as a table tennis and pool table (which isn't level) in the social areas. There is also an on site laundry room, but it will cost about a 5er to do a load of washing and drying which you have to pay for using an app.\\nThe rooms do come with a kitchen (small fridge, ceramic hob, small sink, and a small microwave combi oven), but they aren't particularly useable and my sink was in a state of being perpetually clogged. The issues really start to become apparent if or when something brakes or you need something from maintenance, as it takes a while for any action to be taken. Also worth noting that while I was there, one of the lifts occasionally worked, but was temperamental at best.\",\n",
