0,iq weaver place has been an amazing place to reside in while at uni.

2,amazing on site staff who are always ready and enthusiastic to provide any type of assistance required.
3,would definitely recommend staying here for uni students looking to book accommodation!
4,i am living in classic studio with a window facing to south.
5,the space and decroations of room are decent.
6,there are some features that i quite like.
7,1.the living space is pretty quiet.
8,there is no worry about noise in any time.
9,2.the receptionist is quite kind.
10,"and they will quickly inform you, if your amaz package is reached."
11,3.there are some small gifts or candies during festivals.
12,4.there are two stores near the accomadation.
13,and it takes about 10-min walk to the shopping centre.
14,"basically, if you enjoy a quiet life during your study, that is definately one of best places you want to choose in coventry."
15,i have a very nice experience staying in julian court!
16,all the rooms are studios.
17,the residence is in a quite area so no worry about notices outside.
18,also to go to university of warwick only takes about 20 minutes in total.
19,the staff here are really friendly and helpful.
20,"they can help you with anything, from local life to living experience."
21,i‚Äôll definitely recommend it to those who wish to have a private space to stay.
22,"as a self-contained studio apartment, julian court has all the functions i need to live securely and safely under covid-19 pandemic."
23,and the reception service here is really warm and welcoming.
24,"i like the young lady in reception, she is always enthusiasm when i pick the package"
25,"comfortable, convenient position, good service."
26,an enjoybale living experience.
27,it is suitable for various students.
28,"i love my room, especially the two big windows, from which i can see beautiful sceneries."
29,the furniture inside the room is great and convenient to use.
30,"besides, the administrator at the reception is very enthusiastic and kind."
31,really enjoying living there!
32,i have lived here for more than 4 years and my overall experience with study inn is absolutely amazing.
33,"it has the best arrangements, management and staff and i love how considerate everyone is."

36,always ready to assist the residents and take measures to keep us safe.
37,nice atmosphere.
38,staffs are very friendly and ready to help.
39,need to improve the wifi.
40,if you want to live in an accomondation in the heart of the city centre then this is your place!!
41,the room is excellent with all the necessary tools to live so there is no need to buy anything!!
42,toilet is good but a bit small!!
43,heating during the winter is great and can keep u warm!!
44,"the desk for you to study is large, with enough space to put your books and computer!!"
45,"the staff is friendly, kind (especially the manager of the building and always ready to help even during the night!!"
46,"the only thing that needs an update is the social spaces(more games, spaces to play and engage with each other etc) in the accomondation and more social events in order for all of us to get to know each other!"
47,"!finally, since the building is in the city centre you can confortably explore the city's day and night (social) life with a nice selection of cafes, restaurants and bars (all of them are very close from the accomondation on foot)"
48,fine for location.rooms are spacious but toilets are dated.staff are there all the time and everything is ready to stay so no need to buy anything
49,i‚Äôve never seen a property that clean and cosy.
50,thanks to dorota for helping me even when she doesn‚Äôt work.

54,my studio is spacious and i have an amazing view of the city.
55,the property team is lovely and friendly as well.
56,"lovely management with lovely management, would highly recommend, it‚Äôs the little things that count and they‚Äôre always working around the clock."
57,nice rooms also very good value for money
58,"great staff for the most part, but very unpleasant stay."
59,"constant, constant issues with water, heating, plumbing, general falling apart of the room, lighting, only a couple of weeks after i moved in."
60,higher management didn‚Äôt seem to care about the issues i and plenty other residents had/still have.
61,staff didn‚Äôt tell me when a repair i had was due and entered my room while i was out which is very concerning and an invasion of privacy and didn‚Äôt say anything when i said as much - again didn‚Äôt seem to care.
62,"some tenants very rude and disrespectful without cause - touching my clothes, verbal abuse, staff were aware and didn‚Äôt care, overall awful stay i would highly recommend avoiding this place for your stay, as i have said to every other uni student i know here out of genuine concern for them."
63,i love this place been a blast since i moved in september and it‚Äôs only gone better as my journey continues with ringway house.
